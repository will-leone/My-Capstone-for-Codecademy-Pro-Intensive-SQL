The database file "Codeflix.db" is an exact copy of the online Codecademy database with one exception: the data formatting is "M/D/Y" instead of "Y-mm-dd" (for instance, 1/25/2017 instead of 2017-01-25).

This local version of the Codeflix database was created by:
* copying the online Codecademy result of "SELECT * FROM subscriptions;" to a CSV file
* writing and running a Python script to create a local "Codeflix.db" database consisting of the same subscriptions table
