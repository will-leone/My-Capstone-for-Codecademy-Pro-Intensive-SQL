The database file "Codeflix.db" is an exact copy of the online Codecademy database.

This local version of the Codeflix database was created by:
* Copying the online Codecademy result of "SELECT * FROM subscriptions;" to a CSV file
* Writing and running a Python script to create a local "Codeflix.db" database consisting of the same subscriptions table
